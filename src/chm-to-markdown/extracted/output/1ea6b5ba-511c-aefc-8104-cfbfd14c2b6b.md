The distance between points that are distributed along the path according to the selected layout. When the layout is set to 'FixedDistance' this value can be set to desired distance. The measurement type determines how the distance is measured.

```text
public:
property double Distance {
	double get ();
	void set (double value);
}

# Remarks
This does not take into account points obtained by intersections with other elements. When the layout is set to 'None' the distance is the value that would be used by the 'FixedDistance' layout.
