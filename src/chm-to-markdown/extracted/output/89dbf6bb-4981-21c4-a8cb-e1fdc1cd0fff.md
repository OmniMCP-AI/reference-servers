| [Create(Frame, Curve, Double, Double)](f3e8c800-d92d-d09a-17ba-212d7ebf3b59.md "Create Method \(Frame, Curve, Double, Double\)") | Creates a Surface object coincident with the surface of revolution defined by a coordinate frame, a profile curve, and start and end angles of revolution. |
| [Create(XYZ, XYZ, Curve, Double, Double)](2fdabf9d-39d6-5739-9d28-6ceca0ecf2f5.md "Create Method \(XYZ, XYZ, Curve, Double, Double\)") | Creates a Surface object coincident with the surface of revolution defined by an axis, a profile curve, and start and end angles of revolution. |
| [Dispose](c9ee1344-bc19-d833-52e7-dcc4931fe085.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetBoundingBoxUV](5084214f-219f-780f-fe03-f16b62b2660d.md "GetBoundingBoxUV Method") | Gets the UV bounding box of the surface.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetProfileCurve](fb30e6fc-5fbf-c96d-b66e-b22124fd6394.md "GetProfileCurve Method") | Returns a copy of the profile curve expressed in the surface's coordinate system. |
| [GetProfileCurveInWorldCoordinates](fd977456-eb4a-caf2-1d09-dedc8e1a4317.md "GetProfileCurveInWorldCoordinates Method") | Returns a copy of the profile curve expressed in the world coordinate system. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [IsValidProfileCurve(Frame, Curve)](b0b32fa1-32f7-22bd-a4ae-f62aa777b4c8.md "IsValidProfileCurve Method \(Frame, Curve\)") | Checks if the input profile curve is valid to create a surface of revolution in the given frame of reference. |
| [IsValidProfileCurve(XYZ, XYZ, Curve)](3391c6e4-35e9-23de-7875-374fe5beeb0d.md "IsValidProfileCurve Method \(XYZ, XYZ, Curve\)") | Checks if the input profile curve is valid to create a surface of revolution around the given axis. |
| [Project](802cc09b-d0a4-dfc5-8ca1-e8c5e8cd4ced.md "Project Method") | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [ProjectWithGuessPoint](db8cc42a-9f34-611a-d9c5-852f3935887f.md "ProjectWithGuessPoint Method") | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
