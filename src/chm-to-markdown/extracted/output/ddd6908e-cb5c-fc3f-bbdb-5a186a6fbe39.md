| [FloatingRectangle](d1dcb64c-2f08-d2a6-ddc7-01c76c1a6a59.md "FloatingRectangle Property") | When %dockPosition% is Floating, this rectangle determines the size and position of the pane. Coordinates are relative to the upper-left-hand corner of the main Revit window. Note: the returned Rectangle is a copy.
