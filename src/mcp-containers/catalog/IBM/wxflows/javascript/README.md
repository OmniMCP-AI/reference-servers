# Watsonx.ai Flows Engine

A containerized version of "Watsonx.ai Flows Engine"

> Repository: [IBM/wxflows](https://github.com/IBM/wxflows)

## Description

Here's a step-by-step tutorial for setting up and deploying a project with wxflows, including installing necessary tools, deploying the app, and running it locally.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--ibm--wxflows--javascript
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--ibm--wxflows--javascript 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.


### Configuration

The container supports the following configuration options:




#### Environment Variables

- `WXFLOWS_APIKEY`
- `WXFLOWS_ENDPOINT`
