A containerized version of "@reapi/mcp-openapi"

> Repository: [ReAPI-com/mcp-openapi](https://github.com/ReAPI-com/mcp-openapi)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that loads and serves multiple OpenAPI specifications to enable LLM-powered IDE integrations. This server acts as a bridge between your OpenAPI specifications and LLM-powered development tools like Cursor and other code editors.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--reapi-com--mcp-openapi--mcp-openapi
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--reapi-com--mcp-openapi--mcp-openapi 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.

#### Arguments
