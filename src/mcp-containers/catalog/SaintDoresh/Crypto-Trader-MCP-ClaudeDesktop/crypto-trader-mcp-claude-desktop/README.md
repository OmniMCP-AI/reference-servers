# Crypto Trader MCP Tool

A containerized version of "Crypto Trader MCP Tool"

> Repository: [SaintDoresh/Crypto-Trader-MCP-ClaudeDesktop](https://github.com/SaintDoresh/Crypto-Trader-MCP-ClaudeDesktop)

## Description

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that provides cryptocurrency market data using the CoinGecko API, specifically designed for Claude Desktop.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--saintdoresh--crypto-trader-mcp-claudedesktop--crypto-trader-mcp-claude-desktop
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--saintdoresh--crypto-trader-mcp-claudedesktop--crypto-trader-mcp-claude-desktop 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
