# MCP-timeserver

A containerized version of "MCP-timeserver"

> Repository: [SecretiveShell/MCP-timeserver](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/MCP-timeserver)

## Description

A simple MCP server that exposes datetime information to agentic systems and chat REPLs


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--secretiveshell--mcp-timeserver--mcp-timeserver
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--secretiveshell--mcp-timeserver--mcp-timeserver 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
