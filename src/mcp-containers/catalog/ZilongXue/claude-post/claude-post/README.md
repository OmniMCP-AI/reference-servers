## Description

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a seamless email management interface through Claude. This integration allows you to handle emails directly through natural language conversations with Claude, supporting features like searching, reading, and sending emails securely.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--zilongxue--claude-post--claude-post
