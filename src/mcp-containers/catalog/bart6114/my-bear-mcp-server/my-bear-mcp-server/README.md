# Bear MCP Server

A containerized version of "Bear MCP Server"

> Repository: [bart6114/my-bear-mcp-server](https://github.com/bart6114/my-bear-mcp-server)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants like Claude to read notes from the [Bear](https://bear.app/) note-taking app. This implementation connects directly to the Bear SQLite database in a read-only mode, ensuring your notes remain safe and unmodified.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--bart6114--my-bear-mcp-server--my-bear-mcp-server
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--bart6114--my-bear-mcp-server--my-bear-mcp-server 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.



## Usage with Claude

```json

  "mcpServers": {
