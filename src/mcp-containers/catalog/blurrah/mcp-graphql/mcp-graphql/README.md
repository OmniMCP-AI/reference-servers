A containerized version of "mcp-graphql"

> Repository: [blurrah/mcp-graphql](https://github.com/blurrah/mcp-graphql)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol server that enables LLMs to interact with GraphQL APIs. This implementation provides schema introspection and query execution capabilities, allowing models to discover and use GraphQL APIs dynamically.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--blurrah--mcp-graphql--mcp-graphql
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--blurrah--mcp-graphql--mcp-graphql 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.

The container supports the following configuration options:




#### Environment Variables
