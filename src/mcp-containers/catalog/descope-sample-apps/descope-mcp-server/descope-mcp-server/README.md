# Descope MCP Server

A containerized version of "Descope MCP Server"

> Repository: [descope-sample-apps/descope-mcp-server](https://github.com/descope-sample-apps/descope-mcp-server)

## Description

The Descope Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides an interface to interact with Descope's Management APIs, enabling the search and retrieval of project-related information.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--descope-sample-apps--descope-mcp-server--descope-mcp-server
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--descope-sample-apps--descope-mcp-server--descope-mcp-server 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.

#### Environment Variables

- `DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID`
