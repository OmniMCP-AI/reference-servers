> Repository: [devhub/devhub-cms-mcp](https://github.com/devhub/devhub-cms-mcp)

## Description

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) integration for managing content in the [DevHub CMS system](https://www.devhub.com/).


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--devhub--devhub-cms-mcp--devhub-cms-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--devhub--devhub-cms-mcp--devhub-cms-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
