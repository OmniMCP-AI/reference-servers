# Goal Story MCP Server

A containerized version of "Goal Story MCP Server"

> Repository: [hichana/goalstory-mcp](https://github.com/hichana/goalstory-mcp)

## Description

Goal Story isn’t a goal tracker—it’s a brand new way to manage your aspirations. We call it “Goal Storying.” Instead of juggling endless lists, Goal Story guides you to focus on one goal at a time, forging a deeply personal narrative that keeps you motivated and on track. Powered by conversational AI, Goal Story provides constructive insights and creative storytelling tailored to your unique motivations, helping you see your goal through to completion with a sense of momentum and fun.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--hichana--goalstory-mcp--goalstory-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--hichana--goalstory-mcp--goalstory-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
