# ✨ Lucidity MCP 🔍

A containerized version of "✨ Lucidity MCP 🔍"

> Repository: [hyperb1iss/lucidity-mcp](https://github.com/hyperb1iss/lucidity-mcp)

## Description

AI-powered code quality analysis using MCP to help AI assistants review code more effectively. Analyze git changes for complexity, security issues, and more through structured prompts.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--hyperb1iss--lucidity-mcp--lucidity-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--hyperb1iss--lucidity-mcp--lucidity-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
