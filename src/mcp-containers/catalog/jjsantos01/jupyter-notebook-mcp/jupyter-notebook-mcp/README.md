# JupyterMCP - Jupyter Notebook Model Context Protocol Integration

A containerized version of "JupyterMCP - Jupyter Notebook Model Context Protocol Integration"

> Repository: [jjsantos01/jupyter-notebook-mcp](https://github.com/jjsantos01/jupyter-notebook-mcp)

## Description

JupyterMCP connects [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/chat) through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Jupyter Notebooks. This integration enables AI-assisted code execution, data analysis, visualization, and more.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--jjsantos01--jupyter-notebook-mcp--jupyter-notebook-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--jjsantos01--jupyter-notebook-mcp--jupyter-notebook-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.



## Usage with Claude

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter-notebook-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-it",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--jjsantos01--jupyter-notebook-mcp--jupyter-notebook-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```
