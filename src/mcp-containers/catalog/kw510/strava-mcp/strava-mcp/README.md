# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server + Strava OAuth

A containerized version of "Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server + Strava OAuth"

> Repository: [kw510/strava-mcp](https://github.com/kw510/strava-mcp)

## Description

This is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that supports remote MCP connections, with Strava OAuth built-in. It allows users to connect to your MCP server by signing in with their Strava account.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--kw510--strava-mcp--strava-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--kw510--strava-mcp--strava-mcp https://mcp-strava-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
