## Description

An MCP server implementation providing access to college football statistics sourced from the [College Football Data API](https://collegefootballdata.com/) within [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--lenwood--cfbd-mcp-server--cfbd-mcp-server

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--lenwood--cfbd-mcp-server--cfbd-mcp-server cfbd-mcp-server
