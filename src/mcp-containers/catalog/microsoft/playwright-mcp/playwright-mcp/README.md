# # Playwright MCP

A containerized version of "# Playwright MCP"

> Repository: [microsoft/playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--microsoft--playwright-mcp--playwright-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--microsoft--playwright-mcp--playwright-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
