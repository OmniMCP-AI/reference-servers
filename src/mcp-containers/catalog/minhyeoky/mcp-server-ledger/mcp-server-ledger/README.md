A containerized version of "mcp-server-ledger: A Ledger CLI MCP Server"

> Repository: [minhyeoky/mcp-server-ledger](https://github.com/minhyeoky/mcp-server-ledger)

## Description

A Model Context Protocol server for interacting with Ledger CLI, a powerful double-entry accounting system. This server enables Large Language Models to query and analyze financial data through a standardized interface, making it easy for AI assistants to help with financial reporting, budget analysis, and accounting tasks.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--minhyeoky--mcp-server-ledger--mcp-server-ledger
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--minhyeoky--mcp-server-ledger--mcp-server-ledger 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
