# Jira MCP

A containerized version of "Jira MCP"

> Repository: [nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp)

## Description

A Go-based MCP (Model Control Protocol) connector for Jira that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with Atlassian Jira. This tool provides a seamless interface for AI models to perform common Jira operations.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--nguyenvanduocit--jira-mcp--jira-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--nguyenvanduocit--jira-mcp--jira-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.


### Configuration

The container supports the following configuration options:




#### Environment Variables

- `ATLASSIAN_HOST`
- `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL`
- `ATLASSIAN_TOKEN`
