# Oxylabs MCP Server

A containerized version of "Oxylabs MCP Server"

> Repository: [oxylabs/oxylabs-mcp](https://github.com/oxylabs/oxylabs-mcp)

## Description

The Oxylabs MCP server provides a bridge between AI models and the web. It enables them to scrape any URL, render JavaScript-heavy pages, extract and format content for AI use, bypass anti-scraping measures, and access geo-restricted web data from 195+ countries.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--oxylabs--oxylabs-mcp--oxylabs-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--oxylabs--oxylabs-mcp--oxylabs-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.


### Configuration

The container supports the following configuration options:




#### Environment Variables

- `OXYLABS_USERNAME`
