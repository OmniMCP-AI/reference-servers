# Chess.com MCP Server

A containerized version of "Chess.com MCP Server"

> Repository: [pab1it0/chess-mcp](https://github.com/pab1it0/chess-mcp)

## Description

An MCP server for Chess.com's Published Data API.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--pab1it0--chess-mcp--chess-mcp
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--pab1it0--chess-mcp--chess-mcp 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
