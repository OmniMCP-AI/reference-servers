# Dataset Viewer MCP Server

A containerized version of "Dataset Viewer MCP Server"

> Repository: [privetin/dataset-viewer](https://github.com/privetin/dataset-viewer)

## Description

An MCP server for interacting with the [Hugging Face Dataset Viewer API](https://huggingface.co/docs/dataset-viewer), providing capabilities to browse and analyze datasets hosted on the Hugging Face Hub.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--privetin--dataset-viewer--dataset-viewer
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--privetin--dataset-viewer--dataset-viewer 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
