A containerized version of "MCP Server for Deep Research"

> Repository: [reading-plus-ai/mcp-server-deep-research](https://github.com/reading-plus-ai/mcp-server-deep-research)

## Description

MCP Server for Deep Research is a tool designed for conducting comprehensive research on complex topics. It helps you explore questions in depth, find relevant sources, and generate structured research reports.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--reading-plus-ai--mcp-server-deep-research--mcp-server-deep-research
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--reading-plus-ai--mcp-server-deep-research--mcp-server-deep-research 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
