# Wanaku - A MCP Router that connects everything

A containerized version of "Wanaku - A MCP Router that connects everything"

> Repository: [wanaku-ai/wanaku](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku)

## Description

The Wanaku MCP Router is a router for AI-enabled applications powered by the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--wanaku-ai--wanaku--wanaku
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--wanaku-ai--wanaku--wanaku 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
