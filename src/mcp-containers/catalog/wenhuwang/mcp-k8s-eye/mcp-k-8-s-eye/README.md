A containerized version of "mcp-k8s-eye"

> Repository: [wenhuwang/mcp-k8s-eye](https://github.com/wenhuwang/mcp-k8s-eye)

## Description

mcp-k8s-eye is a tool that can manage kubernetes cluster and analyze workload status.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--wenhuwang--mcp-k8s-eye--mcp-k-8-s-eye
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--wenhuwang--mcp-k8s-eye--mcp-k-8-s-eye 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
