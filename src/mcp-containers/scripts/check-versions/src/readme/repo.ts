<h1 align="center">MCP Containers</h1>

<p align="center">Containerized versions of hundreds of <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">MCP servers</a> 📡 🧠</p>

## Features

- **🚀 Simple Setup** - Just pull the Docker image to use any MCP server
- **🛠️ Always Up-to-Date** - We automatically update the images daily
- **🔒 Secure** - Run MCP servers in isolated containers

## Motivation

While experimenting with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, we found that setting them up could be a bit tedious and time-consuming. 
To simplify the process, we created containerized versions of these servers—making it quick, easy, and secure for anyone to get started.

This repository contains the scripts we use to build and manage these containers using [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com). 
New images are automatically built whenever changes are made to the corresponding server repositories, 
ensuring that our containers are always up-to-date.

We're committed to supporting as many MCP servers as possible. 
If there's a specific server you'd like to see included, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!

## Usage

To use the containers, simply pull the Docker image for the server you want to use. 
We have provided a list of available servers below, along with their respective readme files.

## Featured Servers

${(
  await Promise.all(
    servers.filter(s => featured.has(s.fullId)).map(async server => getServerMarkdown(server))
  )
).join('\n')}

## Available Servers

${(await Promise.all(servers.map(async server => getServerMarkdown(server)))).join('\n')}
